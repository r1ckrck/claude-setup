## Incremental Workflow

The most common cause of bugs is trying to do too much in a single `use_figma` call. Work in small steps and validate after each one.

### The pattern

1. **Inspect first.** Before creating anything, run a read-only `use_figma` to discover what already exists in the file — pages, components, variables, naming conventions. Match what's there.
2. **Do one thing per call.** Create variables in one call, create components in the next, compose layouts in another. Don't try to build an entire screen in one script.
3. **Return IDs from every call.** Always `return` created node IDs, variable IDs, collection IDs as objects (e.g. `return { createdNodeIds: [...] }`). You'll need these as inputs to subsequent calls.
4. **Validate after each step.** Use `get_metadata` to verify structure (counts, names, hierarchy, positions). Use `get_screenshot` after major milestones to catch visual issues.
5. **Fix before moving on.** If validation reveals a problem, fix it before proceeding to the next step. Don't build on a broken foundation.

### Suggested step order for complex tasks

```
Step 1: Inspect file — discover existing pages, components, variables, conventions
Step 2: Create tokens/variables (if needed)
       → validate with get_metadata
Step 3: Create individual components
       → validate with get_metadata + get_screenshot
Step 4: Compose layouts from component instances
       → validate with get_screenshot
Step 5: Final verification
```

### What to validate at each step

| After... | Check with `get_metadata` | Check with `get_screenshot` |
|---|---|---|
| Creating variables | Collection count, variable count, mode names | — |
| Creating components | Child count, variant names, property definitions | Variants visible, not collapsed, grid readable |
| Binding variables | Node properties reflect bindings | Colors/tokens resolved correctly |
| Composing layouts | Instance nodes have mainComponent, hierarchy correct | No cropped/clipped text, no overlapping elements, correct spacing |


## `get_metadata` vs `get_screenshot`

After each `use_figma` call, validate results using the right tool for the job. Do NOT reach for `get_screenshot` every time — it is expensive and should be reserved for visual checks.

### `get_metadata` — Use for intermediate validation (preferred)

`get_metadata` returns an XML tree of node IDs, types, names, positions, and sizes. Use it to confirm:

- **Structure & hierarchy**: correct parent-child relationships, component nesting, section contents
- **Node counts**: expected number of variants created, children present
- **Naming**: variant property names follow the `property=value` convention
- **Positioning & alignment**: x/y coordinates, width/height values match expectations
- **Layout properties**: auto-layout direction, sizing mode, padding, spacing
- **Component set membership**: all expected variants are inside the ComponentSet

```
Example: After creating a ComponentSet with 120 variants, call get_metadata on the
ComponentSet node to verify all 120 children exist with correct names, sizes, and positions
— without waiting for a full render.
```

**When to use `get_metadata`:**
- After creating/modifying nodes — to verify structure, counts, and names
- After layout operations — to verify positions and dimensions
- After combining variants — to confirm all components are in the ComponentSet
- After binding variables — to verify node properties (use use_figma to read bound variables if needed)
- Between multi-step workflows — to confirm step N succeeded before starting step N+1

### `get_screenshot` — Use after each major creation milestone

`get_screenshot` renders a pixel-accurate image. It is the only way to verify visual correctness (colors, typography rendering, effects, variable mode resolution). It is slower and produces large responses, so don't call it after every single `use_figma` — but do call it after each major milestone to catch visual problems early.

**When to use `get_screenshot`:**
- **After creating a component set** — verify variants look correct, grid is readable, nothing is collapsed or overlapping
- **After composing a layout** — verify overall structure and spacing
- **After binding variables/modes** — verify colors and tokens resolved correctly
- **After any fix or recovery** — verify the fix didn't introduce new visual issues
- **Before reporting results to the user** — final visual proof

**What to look for in screenshots** — these are the most commonly missed issues:
- **Cropped/clipped text** — line heights or frame sizing cutting off descenders, ascenders, or entire lines
- **Overlapping content** — elements stacking on top of each other due to incorrect sizing or missing auto-layout
- **Placeholder text** still showing ("Title", "Heading", "Button") instead of actual content

## Error Recovery After Failed `use_figma`

**`use_figma` is atomic — failed scripts do not execute.** If a script errors, no changes are made to the file. The file remains in exactly the same state as before the call. There are no partial nodes, no orphaned elements, and retrying after a fix is safe.

**Recovery steps when `use_figma` returns an error:**
1. **STOP — do NOT immediately fix the code and retry.** Read the error message carefully first.
2. **Understand the error.** Most errors are caused by wrong API usage, missing font loads, invalid property values, or referencing nodes that don't exist.
3. **If the error is unclear**, call `get_metadata` or `get_screenshot` to understand the current file state and confirm nothing has changed.
4. **Fix the script** based on the error message.
5. **Retry** the corrected script.

## Self-Correction Patterns

### Common error messages

| Error message | Likely cause | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| `"not implemented"` | Used `figma.notify()` | Remove it — use `return` for output |
| `"node must be an auto-layout frame..."` | Set `FILL`/`HUG` before appending to auto-layout parent | Move `appendChild` before `layoutSizingX = 'FILL'` |
| `"Setting figma.currentPage is not supported"` | Used sync page setter | Use `await figma.setCurrentPageAsync(page)` |
| Property value out of range | Color channel > 1 (used 0–255 instead of 0–1) | Divide by 255 |
| `"Cannot read properties of null"` | Node doesn't exist (wrong ID, wrong page) | Check page context, verify ID |
| Script hangs / no response | Infinite loop or unresolved promise | Check for `while(true)` or missing `await`; ensure code terminates |
| `"The node with id X does not exist"` | Parent instance was implicitly detached by a child `detachInstance()`, changing IDs | Re-discover nodes by traversal from a stable (non-instance) parent frame |

### When the script succeeds but the result looks wrong

1. Call `get_metadata` to check structural correctness (hierarchy, counts, positions).
2. Call `get_screenshot` to check visual correctness. Look closely for cropped/clipped text (line heights cutting off content) and overlapping elements — these are common and easy to miss.
3. Identify the discrepancy — is it structural (wrong hierarchy, missing nodes) or visual (wrong colors, broken layout, clipped content)?
4. Write a targeted fix script that modifies only the broken parts — don't recreate everything.


## Recommended Workflow

```
1. use_figma  →  Create/modify nodes
2. get_metadata     →  Verify structure, counts, names, positions (fast, cheap)
3. use_figma  →  Fix any structural issues found
4. get_metadata     →  Re-verify fixes
5. ... repeat as needed ...
6. get_screenshot   →  Visual check after each major milestone

⚠️ ON ERROR at any step:
   a. Read the error message carefully
   b. get_metadata / get_screenshot  →  If the error is unclear, inspect file state
   c. Fix the script based on the error
   d. Retry the corrected script (safe — failed scripts don't modify the file)
```
